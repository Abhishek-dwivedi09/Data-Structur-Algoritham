    /*
    Recursion is a programming technique where a method calls itself to solve a problem. A recursive method solves a problem by breaking it down into smaller instances of the same problem,
    until it reaches a simple case that can be solved directly (the base case).
    How Recursion Works in Java
    In Java, recursion works through these key elements:

    Method Self-Invocation: A recursive method contains a statement where the method calls itself.
            Base Case(s): Every recursive solution must have one or more base cases that do not require further recursion and return a value directly. Without a base case,
             the recursion would continue indefinitely, causing a stack overflow error.
    Recursive Case: The part of the method where it calls itself with a modified argument that brings the problem closer to the base case.
    Call Stack: Java maintains a call stack that keeps track of method calls and their local variables. Each recursive call adds a new frame to the stack.
